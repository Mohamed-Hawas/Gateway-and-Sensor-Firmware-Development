## Objectives
### Gateway Development:

- Design a flexible, scalable architecture for multi-sensor data handling.

- Ensure reliable concurrent BLE connections (8+ sensors, fallback to 5+).

- Implement low-latency data forwarding via Wi-Fi/Ethernet using MQTT.

- Enable OTA updates for gateway firmware and BLE sensors.

- Integrate fault tolerance and recovery mechanisms.


### Sensor Firmware Development:

- Rewrite PSRAM driver using nrfx library for high-speed data buffering.

- Optimize EEPROM access and integrate error-handling mechanisms.

- Transition MEMS vibration sensor sampling to FIFO method for higher sampling rates (26.67 kHz).

- Conduct system-wide testing and validation.

## Scope of Work
### Phase 1: Foundation & Prototyping (Weeks 1–5)
#### Gateway:

- Define architecture and communication protocols (BLE, MQTT).

- Prototype BLE concurrency and MQTT data forwarding.

#### Sensor Firmware:

## Risks & Mitigation

| Risk                          | Mitigation |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| BLE concurrency issues        | Use Nordic’s SoftDevice scheduler and optimize connection intervals.                           |
| High data rate bottlenecks    | Benchmark PSRAM/FIFO early; optimize DMA and buffer sizes.                                    |
| OTA update failures           | Implement watchdog timers, checksum validation, and rollback mechanisms.                      |
| Integration delays with platform | Align with platform team early and define data format/API specifications.                   |
